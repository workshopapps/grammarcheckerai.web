            The ease with which we use computers substantially influences the likelihood that technology may disrupt a
            particular element of life or business. Computers were far less user-friendly when we needed to enter code
            into a command line only to load a software. However, the mouse and graphical user interfaces made things
            much simpler, and computers grew from specialist goods to become commonplace. Touch advanced the situation
            further, contributing to the development of a society in which most individuals wear a computer on their
            wrist in addition to carrying one in their pocket. What is the upcoming field that will advance
            human-computer interactions? conversant AI.

            You may believe that voice interfaces are nothing new because talkative smartphone assistants have been
            available for more than a decade. But you&apos;ve probably noticed that those assistants have improved in terms
            of listening skills, conversational skills, and overall usefulness. This is due to a number of technological
            advancements that have taken place in the background that have improved smartphone experiences as well as
            the integration of AI-powered voice technologies into a number of new products and use cases.

            For instance, BERT, a method for natural language processing that makes speech models more context-aware and
            easier and faster to train, was open-sourced by Google AI researchers. One of Google&apos;s Alphabet siblings,
            DeepMind, also unveiled WaveNet, which replaced phonetic models with ones that utilize waveforms to forecast
            which sounds are likely to follow one another in order to produce substantially more realistic-sounding
            synthetic voices. Both technologies are now deeply embedded and they&apos;re just a few among many examples of
            advances that help computers not only interact with us more naturally, but also act on our requests more
            effectively.

            Soon, most human-computer interactions may not involve completing a series of set actions — clicking or
            swiping our way along a well-defined user journey — so much as just talking to machines and expecting them
            to keep up, even as the conversation changes course or topic.
